- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @WhiteYang
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in DIY, hardware (phone,PC and other electric things) and some programming activities.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning so many things...Haha, learning is always hard but I'm wiling to face the difficulties. Happiness comes after the works are done,isn't it?
- ğŸ“« How to reach me:Oh, that's a secret now. I've just been here, being eager to learn more.
